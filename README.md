## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by the closet outfit generator from the movie 'Clueless', however i personalised the prototype by solving time constraint issues & avoiding decision fatigue when deciding outfits that are suitable for weather conditions.

This code in this project was laregly guided by the 'TkinterPthyon' Youtube channel tutorials.
