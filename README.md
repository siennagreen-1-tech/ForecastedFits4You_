## Project Overview
Forecasted Fits 4 You is a digital weather-based outfit generator designed to help users make quicker, more convenient, and weather-appropriate clothing decisions. Built with Python, this prototype features a simple and interactive GUI that generates random outfit combinations based on the user’s selected weather condition. The application displays paired images of ‘top’ and ‘bottom’ clothing items, creating a complete look that aligns with the chosen forecast.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.14 - Core programming language
* Tkinter - Provides the graphical user interface (GUI) framework for user interaction
* Pillow (PIL) - Handles image processing and display
* OS Module - Manages file paths and directory operations
* Random Module - Selects random images to display)

## Acknowledgements
This project was inspired by the closet outfit generator from the movie 'Clueless', however i personalised the prototype by solving time constraint issues & avoiding decision fatigue when deciding outfits that are suitable for weather conditions.
